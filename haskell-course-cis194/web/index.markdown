Course Description
------------------

Haskell is a high-level, pure functional programming language with a
strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings, and
is being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as
Facebook, AT&T, and NASA.  In the first 3/4 of the course, we will
explore the joys of pure, lazy, typed functional programming in
Haskell (warning: euphoric, mind-bending epiphanies may result!).  The
last 1/4 of the course will consist of case studies in fun and
interesting applications of Haskell. Potential case study topics
include automated randomized testing, software transactional memory,
graphics generation, parser combinators, or others as time and
interest allow.  Evaluation will be based on class participation,
weekly programming assignments, and an open-ended final project.
