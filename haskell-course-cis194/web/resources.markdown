Piazza
------

* We will be using [Piazza](piazza.com) for announcements and as a place
  for you to ask questions.  [Click here to enroll](http://piazza.com/upenn/spring2013/cis194).


Installation and coding environment
-----------------------------------

* Visit the [Haskell Platform download
  page](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) for Windows, Mac, and
  Linux installers and instructions.

* If you have a favorite text editor (such as emacs or vim) it will
  work just fine for editing Haskell programs. There is a nice
  [haskell-mode for
  emacs](http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-emacs/).  Vim comes
  with syntax highlighting for Haskell out of the box; for more
  options [try this vim haskell
  mode](http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-vim/).  Other editors
  commonly used with Haskell include Nodepad++, TextMate, Gedit, or Sublime.

* If you are familiar/comfortable with
  [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), there is
  [EclipseFP](http://eclipsefp.github.com/), a full-featured Haskell
  plug-in for Eclipse.

* For the intrepid, there's
  [Yi](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Yi), a text editor written
  *and extensible* in Haskell (just like emacs is extensible in
  emacs-lisp).  It is quite amazing, but tends to be difficult to
  install.

Help/community
--------------

* Your first stop for asking questions related to this course should be
  [Piazza](piazza.com).  However, if you have questions of a more
  general nature or are interested in exploring the larger Haskell
  community, read on!

* The [\#haskell IRC
  channel](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel) is a great
  place to get help.  Strange as it may seem if you've spent time in
  other IRC channels, \#haskell is always full of friendly, helpful
  people.

* [tryhaskell.org](http://tryhaskell.org/) gives you a ghci session in
  your browser, and includes a very simple tutorial.  It also features
  an interface to the \#haskell IRC channel.

* [hpaste.org](http://hpaste.org) is a good place to paste programs
  you're having trouble with in order to get help from people in
  \#haskell.

* Many people from the Haskell community are active on
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell),
  which can be a good place to ask questions.

* The [Haskell-beginners mailing
  list](http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/beginners) is a good place
  to ask beginner-level questions.

* The [Haskell-cafe mailing
  list](http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe) can also be
  a good place to ask questions, but is much higher-traffic.

* The Haskell wiki has a
  [list of frequently asked questions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FAQ).

Reading
-------

* [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/), by Bryan
  O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen, published by O'Reilly.  A
  thorough and detailed introduction to Haskell that gets into the
  nitty gritty of using Haskell effectively in the "real world".  Can
  be read online for free, or in dead tree form.

* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
  is a whimsical and easy-to-follow Haskell tutorial, with super
  awesome illustrations.  Also available online or in dead tree form.

* The [Haskell wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)
  actually contains a substantial amount of well-written information;
  a great resource if you're having trouble understanding a particular
  topic and want a different approach.

* The [Haskell wiki](http://www.haskell.org/) is a huge grab-bag of
  all sorts of information, examples, explanations.  The quality
  varies but it's definitely a great resource.

* The
  [Typeclassopedia](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia)
  explains many of the type classes in the standard libraries
  (`Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, `Monoid`, `Arrow`, `Foldable`,
  `Traversable`...).

* [Planet Haskell](http://planet.haskell.org/) aggregates blog posts
  from the Haskell community.

* There is a [Haskell subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) for
  aggregating Haskell-related websites, blog posts, and news.

Reference
---------

* [Standard library documentation](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html).

* A useful [Haskell cheatsheet](http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com/).

* [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/) is a huge repository of
  Haskell packages.  If it isn't on Hackage, it doesn't exist.
  Packages can be automatically downloaded and installed from Hackage
  using the
  [cabal-install](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install)
  tool.

* Looking for a function but don't know what it's called?  Want to see
  the documentation for a particular function?
  [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) searches many standard
  libraries and can search either by name or by type.

* [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html) is another
  search engine for the Haskell documentation, which is much more
  complete (it searches all of Hackage).

* If you really want the nitty-gritty details of the Haskell language
  standard, see the [2010 Haskell
  report](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/).
