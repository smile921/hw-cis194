Lateness
--------

* Homework assignments are due by the *beginning of class* (1:30 pm)
  each Monday.

* Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 2 points (out of
    a total of 20) per day (or partial day).  For example, homework may be
    submitted up to 1:30pm on Tuesday for a 2 point penalty, 1:30pm on
    Wednesday for a 4 point penalty, and so on.  Note that the same
    penalties apply to revisions as well as initial submissions.

Collaboration/academic honesty
------------------------------

Collaboration on homework is encouraged.  You are also free to consult
any outside sources such as tutorials, books, or wikis, and to seek
help from sources such as the [#haskell IRC channel on freenode](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel) or
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell) (though your first stop for questions should be
[piazza](http://piazza.com/upenn/spring2013/cis194)).

However, the following restrictions apply:

* Homework solutions *must be written individually*.  Copying of any
  portions of code is strictly forbidden.

* You *must cite* any people or resources you consulted in completing
  an assignment.  For example, at the top of an assignment you might
  write something like
  
    > I collaborated with Grace Hopper and Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel on
    > this assignment, received help from `edwardk` in `#haskell`, and
	> consulted `http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Combinatory_logic` and
    > `http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14585220/understanding-a-rank-2-type-alias-with-a-class-constraint`.
  
Academic dishonesty of any form will not be tolerated, and will
typically result in a score of zero on the assignments in question, at
the very least.

Grading
-------

Each homework assignment is graded on the following scale:

  * a maximum of 15 points for correctness
  * a maximum of 5 points for style
  
A revised version of each assignment may be submitted by the due date
of the subsequent assignment.  The final grade on an assignment is
computed as follows:

  * the *average* of the initial and revised correctness scores, plus
  * the *maximum* of the initial and revised style scores.
  
Final grades will computed as a weighted average:

  * 75% homework
  * 25% final project
