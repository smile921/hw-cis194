Really playing with fire here!  We tell them to implement Ord for
GuestList but say nothing about Eq.  In fact, the solution currently
derives Eq for GuestList but then defines Ord by comparing fun
scores.  This is, of course, a no-no to have such different instances!
It can come around to bite you if you define the Ord instance by
defining (<=) -- the default implementation of 'compare' calls (==) so
can give seemingly bizarre results.

In practice, nothing in the assignment will really call compare -- but
our tester does which is why I noticed.  And anyway it would be nice
to have everything on the up-and-up.  Not sure what the best solution
is.

John:
Adding to this: having them define their own datatype makes it pretty
hard to write a tester that can properly pattern match or build
instances.
